### Overview
For my second project, I was given 5 days to design and build a fully RESTful ExpressJS app based on a review site, utilising MongoDB, Express and Node.js. Git was used for version control and Heroku for deployment.

### The Application

Taking Trip Advisor as inspiration I decided to build Visor Advisor. A site for people to add, rate and review visors.

### Features

Users can search by type of visor on the site or just browse the main collection. For each visor users can view their stats, overall rating and where the visor was 'spotted' last, via a Google Maps marker. Users can also favourite, and comment on the visors.
